# 🌟 Mini Projects

🗂️ About This Repository
A personal collection of beginner web projects built with HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
Each project is simple, responsive and created to practice structure, layout and basic interactivity.

While most of the projects were built in 2023, I pushed them to GitHub in 2025 
as part of my learning archive and to make them easily accessible online.
These mini projects reflect my learning journey and have helped me 
strengthen my frontend skills one step at a time.
