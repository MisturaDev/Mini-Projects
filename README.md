# 🌟 Mini Projects

## 🗂️ About This Repository

A personal collection of beginner web projects built with **HTML**, **CSS** and some **JavaScript**.  
Each project is simple, responsive and designed to practice structure, layout and basic interactivity.

Most of these projects were created in 2023 and pushed to GitHub in 2025 as part of my learning archive.  
They reflect my development journey and have helped me strengthen my frontend skills step by step.
